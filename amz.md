The whirl of conveyors and the vibe of a prison are constants. The mixed community of redistributors has their motto: "We spread waste, we waste time, we waste the possibility of our future." The world's largest machine is set in a landscape full of waterfalls of boxes, rivers of boxes, and the microplastics within them that enter into we. This place feels so unnatural that it seems it can't be a real place for life. Outside, hills are nearby, a river runs close by, and in the distance, there are trees, but at your feet, there is only asphalt for parking for 900 or so cars. In another direction, a house overlooks the factory from afar. I just noticed it today; it seems to oversee everything, and you could imagine a CEO vacationing at the 2nd home. Now, imagine me as a temporary staffing `variable`, that's a description, I didn't make it up, imagine you waking up early for a shift that in the winter could prevent you from seeing the light of day on a Saturday. Sounds terrible, right?

The humming of the machines silences us. We are given two options to protect our ears: over-ear or in-ear protection, which is supposed to keep us safe. While the sounds can be avoided, the dangers posed by cardboard boxes, plastic containers, tools, and machines that move them are not as easy to avoid. Safety is further compromised by ever-changing leadership, shifting tactics, fluctuating co-workers, ongoing construction, and quota changes that make each day unpredictable. If the noises doesn't limit communication, the two tier system of people using Slack or people reaching out to leadership in a digital public forum, and those not should divide folks. The system of white or blue badges, whites being the variables, the blues, it's not clear or guaranteed that you will get this badge, by design most people shouldn't.

It’s hard to improve from one day to the next in this role, as nobody refers to me by my name; instead, I am identified by my unique `ID`. This `ID`, along with my picture, has been added to a board where I am randomly assigned to different parts of the factory. Previously, we were stationed in one spot, performing the same tasks with the same people, and agreements between us were honored each day. However, the group collectively lost the trust of management and was collectively punished. This form of punishment is presented as fair, and should be expected. We are expected to continue on and handle each box with care and love, meeting our collective goal of moving boxes, goals which are provided from leadership to us early in the morning. We also get to revisit this after lunch and after inadequate stretching. The stretching will help with the no sitting, and break rooms are only for breaks. On the topic of breaks, and sitting, it's 2 15 minute breaks, and that includes walking. That's 20, they took 10. The work is dangerous, you have to be on point, but points are only deducted from you. It seems like you can only get better at it if you become less human. And that's why they need more humans to break.

But this is work. Work that involves constant surveillance, and I have volunteered to take on the additional labor of being a surveillant. Maybe, I hope, we can later convey something different through sound and sight to show empathy. A creation of art, because most people aren't feeling it yet. They don’t ship art in the fc.
