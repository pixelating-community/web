# **iamz fc a, sorry**

The whirl of conveyors and the vibe of a prison are constants. The mixed community of redistributors has their motto: "We spread waste, we waste time, we waste the possibility of our future." The world's largest machine is set in a landscape full of waterfalls of boxes, rivers of boxes, and the microplastics within them that enter into we. This place feels so unnatural that it seems it can't be real life. Outside, the hills are nearby, a river runs close by, and in the distance, there are green trees. At my feet, there is asphalt for parking ~900 vehicles. In another direction, a house overlooks the factory from afar. I just noticed it today; it seems to oversee everything. I often imagine a CEO living there, one of many such houses. I spend a lot of time lost in thought here, trying to distract myself from the fact that this isn't working and isn't my career choice. I've amounted to nothing more than what the labels me: a temporary staffing `variable`.

The humming of the machines silences us. We are given two options to protect our ears: over-ear or in-ear protection, which is supposed to keep us safe. While the sounds can be avoided, the dangers posed by cardboard boxes, plastic containers, tools, and machines that move them are not as easy to avoid. Safety is further compromised by ever-changing leadership, shifting tactics, fluctuating co-workers, ongoing construction, and quota changes that make each day unpredictable. It’s hard to improve from one day to the next in this role, as nobody refers to me by my name; instead, I am identified by my unique ID. This ID, along with my picture, has been added to a board where I am randomly assigned to different parts of the factory. Previously, we were stationed in one spot, performing the same tasks with the same people, and agreements between us were honored each day. However, the group collectively lost the trust of management and was collectively punished. This form of punishment is presented as fair but is a resource available to all here. One way to escape the feeling of contributing to this punishment is to stand on the glossy hard floor from early morning until evening. The required protective boots do little to shield us from the unnatural work; in fact, they often make things worse. We are expected to handle each box with care and love, meeting our collective goal of touching each box over 70,000 times. We will revisit this after lunch and after stretching while standing—Standing Yoga, with no mats required, no sitting, and no leaning on anything. The work is dangerous. It seems like you can only get better at it if you become less human.

But this is life. A life that involves constant surveillance, and I have volunteered to take on the additional labor of being a surveillant. Maybe, I hope, we can later convey something different through sound and sight to show empathy. A creation of art, because most people aren't feeling it yet. They don’t ship art in the fc.
